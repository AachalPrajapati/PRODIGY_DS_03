# PRODIGY_DS_03

## 📌 Objective
To build a Decision Tree classification model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a product based on demographic and behavioral data.

## 📊 Dataset
**Bank Marketing Dataset**  
The dataset contains information about customers such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous marketing interactions.

Target Variable:
- `y` → Whether the customer subscribed (`yes` / `no`)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Handled and encoded categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualized the decision tree

## 🤖 Model Used
- DecisionTreeClassifier  
- Criterion: Entropy  
- Max Depth: 5  

## ✅ Results
The model was able to predict customer subscription behavior with good accuracy and provided insights into key decision factors.
